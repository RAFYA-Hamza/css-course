Specificity is calculated based on the types of selectors used in a CSS rule. It is typically represented as a set of four values (a, b, c, d):

a: Inline styles (e.g., style="color: red;")
b: IDs (e.g., #header)
c: Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes (e.g., .btn, [type="text"], :hover)
d: Element names and pseudo-elements (e.g., div, h1, ::before)
